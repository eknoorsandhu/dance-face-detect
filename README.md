# dance-face-detect

Small project to learn ML and make a useful tool for myself. As a Kathak dancer I record videos of myself practicing and can use this tool to capture moments in the video during 360 degree spins, where my face is visible.

## Description

## Notes

- Using `python 3.11`. Ran into package deprecation issues with `python 3.12` while using `mtcnn`.
